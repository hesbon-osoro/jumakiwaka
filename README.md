### HiðŸ‘‹! 
I am Juma Kiwaka, a software developer. I currently focus on building for the web using javascript and it's associated libraries and frameworks such as react, angular and node. I like to challenge myself to do more than what is expected of me or what I think I am capable of doingðŸ˜„. I am constantly leveling up on technologies that I am currently using or those that I am interesting in using later on. On the side, I also love cycling:bike:, football:soccer: and reading books:book: about life, money, psychology and people!
